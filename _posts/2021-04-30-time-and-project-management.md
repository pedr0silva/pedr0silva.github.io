Apparently, it seems that the time has come to address an issue that has been haunting me for a few months. Self-management.

Most of my days, I tend to have a difficult time focusing on my tasks and often get distracted by other lesser important activities, which is exacerbated by the fact that I actually have a lot to do. In consequence, this leads me to believe I use procrastination as a way to escape my tight schedule. It obviously makes things worse, as time passes by and my stress levels rise significantly. It just seems so strange to me that a grown man with responsibilities takes this sort of escape even tho he recognizes and foresees the problems that lurk under it's surface.

# Why?
<p>
"Trait procrastinators have been thought to engage in dilatory behavior for a variety of reasons. These include the protection of their self-esteem through self-handicapping, the avoidance of aversive tasks, a demonstration of autonomy, an avoidance of state anxiety, a response to their fear of failure or perfectionist tendencies and because they lack self-regulation and self-management capabilities (Burka & Yuen, 1983; Ellis & Knaus, 1977; Frost, Marten, Lahart, & Rosenblate, 1990; Harre, 1984; Lachenicht, 1992; Lay, 1990; Milgram, Sroloff, & Rosenbaum, 1988; Ottens, 1982; Solomon & Rothblum, 1984)." Even though some of these assumptions have been questioned, namely regarding perfectionism (Flett, Blankstein, Hewitt, & Koledin, 1992; Flett, Hewitt, & Martin, in press), self-handicapping (Lay, Knish, & Zanatta, 1992), and fear of failure (Schouwenburg, 1992, in press), I personally feel a deep need to avoid frustrating or boring tasks, not to mention the lack of self-management capabilities. This is probably my worse characteristic and may become my doom if I don't solve this issue soon enough. Doubting my ability to write in english cripples my proactivity towards a better performance at my studies and exponentially increases my levels of stress during the day.

"
Stress is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation. If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease).
" (Michie, 2002)

Regarding individual stress management, Dr Susan Michie proposes that stress can be prevented through awareness of it's signs, interrupting behavior patterns when the stress reaction is just beginning, so things never get "too stressful", planning ahead to minimize stressful situations and learning skills of active coping and relaxation (2002).

I'm sensing a theme here...

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, psychologist and professor of the University of Toronto has been giving lectures all over the world about different topics of human psychology, mainly responsibility and self-management. In one of his Patreon Q&A sessions, he was asked how he could travel the world with a very tight schedule and still maintain mental sharpness, to which he responded that he plans his days obsessively because "...it leads to way higher productivity" (2017). 

His last works before moving on to a different question were quite terrifying:
"Responsibilities are those things that ruin your life if you don't fulfill them" (Peterson, 2017).

While working on this post, I realized once again that my attention span is fairly short, so need a sprint technique that rewards me with a balance between getting things done as well as time to breathe, read or procrastinate for a few minutes.

# Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique was initially conceived by Francesco Cirillo in the 80's to manage his own schedule, dividing his todo list into a large number of time spans (25 minutes - 1 pomodoro [time unit]) and marking how many pomodoros it would take him to finish each task. It's basically a game, isn't it?

"
The Pomodoro represents an abstraction of time, a box that can hold and limit becoming and on which time depends, in the end. It’s precisely by breaking and inverting our dependency on becoming that a different vision of time emerges. By measuring ourselves against a finite abstraction of time - the Pomodoro - we can succeed in breaking our direct dependency on the concept of becoming.
" (Cirillo, 2007)

The "real" Pomodoro Technique requires a fixed amount of time to be a successful as well as planning and archiving sessions, which I feel will set me back if I start using it in the middle of my personal chaos. As such, I will use a soft version of Pomodoro for the time being, working for about thirty to forty-five minutes before taking ten minute breaks, which should be a huge improvement over my "go with the flow" attitude. By the end of the module, with a week or so to organize the next one, I will start implementing a true and original version of the technique.

I confess that the idea of citing a meme made me smile.
