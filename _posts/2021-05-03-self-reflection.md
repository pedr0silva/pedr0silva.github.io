While sitting back in my comfortable chair, listening to the Outer Wilds' Soundtrack and looking outside at the houses of my neighbors, whose paint job is constantly ruined by the sea-salted air, I come to realise life can offer beauty in the most common of places. I just had to stop for a second and look at the same old thing, with a different mindset.

My supposedly called "routine" is absolute chaos these days. I find myself dropping one task and getting to a new one extremely often, which reflects both my lack of time management skills and ability to sort out priorities. From time to time, for a bit of momentary relief, I force myself to believe that the sheer amount of mental gymnastics I'm practising has to provide some positive outcome, eventually. Nevertheless, I need to evolve in terms of self-management. I am very possibly performing at very low amounts of productivity.

I found this extremely insightful piece of an article, where the authors give an example of a highly organized and productive lady called Irene:

<span style="color:#f08d49">"</span>
Take a minute or two to reflect on your day at work. Was it like Irene’s? Were you able to accomplish everything you had hoped to accomplish, or did you have to carry forward many important tasks from today’s to-do list to tomorrow’s? Did you feel rushed or compelled to cut corners? How about your subordinates? Did they complete all their assignments, or did they also come up short?

If you answered yes to these questions, you are in a time squeeze.

I am in a time squeeze...

On another note, in the recent past I have doubted the decision of enrolling in the course although, if I balance the positives and negatives of the experience so far, the positive aspects are winning by a large margin. Not only the content is centered on personal experimentation and reflection, which I really enjoy, but moreover has brought to my attention other forms of art, authors and practitioners, especially by allowing me the freedom to explore topics my won way. I am also starting to appreciate the value of journaling thoughts, ideas and creations along the way.

One of the obstacles I'm facing is my confidence in writing in English. To this day, and probably until the end of the module, I will keep these posts to myself. I am aware that this may be holding me back from improving my writing skills as well as my game development practice. As such, for the near future, and especially the modules that follow, I will try to be more active in the forums, discuss concepts and ideas with my peers as well as share my unfinished work sooner than later.

# S.M.A.R.T Goals

<br />
While there is no documented proof of definitive authoring of the acronym, the concept has been referenced by many different scholars and philosophers for centuries (Lawlor and Hornyak, 2012), and aims to create intrinsic connections between an end-goal and it's <span style="color:#f08d49">s</span>pecific, <span style="color:#f08d49">m</span>easurable, <span style="color:#f08d49">a</span>ttainable, <span style="color:#f08d49">r</span>ealistic and <span style="color:#f08d49">t</span>imely steps, creating a more motivating and analytic process. In the 60's, Dr. Edwin Locke concluded that specific and challenging goals were more motivational than vague and easy ones, theory that was complemented greatly by his collaborative work with Gary Latham, developing five fundamental principles of effective goal setting (Lawlor and Hornyak, 2012).
Therefor, the S.M.A.R.T goals method of self-improvement is very understandably a great upgrade over the common goal definition. Making measurable goals, especially, may be essential to having a better notion on how your are evolving along the journey. Many of my ideas or future projects have a very specific and achievable goal, but fall into the terribly-planned project category. I would like to add, for my own personal twist, that the goals should provide a rewarding experience. For me, a very important part of working towards a specific goal, is to enjoy most of the process needed to attain it.

As a way of enhancing my skills in the scope of game development, here is my S.M.A.R.T goal proposition:
"
I will improve at shader and material creation so I can become a valuable part of the artistic workflow of my team's projects, which will improve the overall professionalism and polish of said projects. I will achieve this by creating one shader per week, in my free time, starting from simple shaders to progressively more complex. I will commit two hours each week for this activity. Furthermore, I will record the creative sessions so I can make them available to my students, helping them learn from my mistakes and experience.
"

This method, alongside with my previous suggestion of daily planning may become crucial for my future development as eventually, with time and experience, I will shift my goal to becoming an independent developer.
