I regularly find myself looking at gamedev reddit posts without a reason to. If I'm not searching for anything, why am I mindlessly scrolling through reddit?
Considering the amount of time I may have wasted on reddit and youtube videos in the past year, I'm sure I could have done a full simple game out of those long loose hours. Even though this, in itself, is problematic, the sense of fake accomplishment I get is even worse.

From examining the situation, I have taken a step back regarding the resources I use to gain knowledge in the game development field. While I previously believed books were unnecessary in this area of study, nowadays I'm not so sure, as using exclusively the web can become overwhelming very fast. It is just too noisy, full of distractions.

Searching for good books for the subtopics of game development I am most interested in was a pain at first, since there is a lot of clutter around. Eventually I found this  [github repository](https://github.com/miloyip/game-programmer) which contains a curated list of quality books on the topic of game programming (mostly).

I appreciate the fact that so many creators have taken the time to post videos and blogs about their development practice and the fact that we can learn so much from it, but inevitably becomes very hard to do proper information filtering. For such task, I am using Zotero, a software recommended in the first module of the MA. It allows me to organize all the useful articles, videos, tutorials, among other content and extract proper references. 

It is a frequent event, in the game dev community, to see people rant and toss words around about how a game should be or look and what kinds of projects someone starting their development practice should create. Even though I would prefer unbiased feedback from anonymous people over the internet,  because  "Anonymous advice is both franker and more effective", but "... unfortunately this is seldom practical, for authors, in citing references, tend to refer most to themselves.".

The MA is helping me clear my notion of what a game can be and the necessary steps to properly plan one. I've also been interested in a bigger range of art forms that previously were unknown to me. Most notably the discovery of [David OReilley’s work](http://www.davidoreilly.com/works) and [Eirik Brandal’s sculptures](https://eirikbrandal.com/), which I find fascinating and inspiring.

After reflecting on these thoughts I have decided to make an effort to read more from established authors in hopes they will provide me with deeper knowledge and hence support my practice for a longer period of time.
