title: Consuming unidentified potions
---

Hey!

Today I
was surfing the web | again
looking at gamedev reddits | again
realized I am in a loop of procrastination | again

The problem seems to be the fact that I don't really know what I am capable of doing anymore. I have this sense of fake accomplishment every time I watch a video or read a post from someone with success on something that I see myself doing, when in reality I am just watching someone else's life being lived.

I am beginning to question everything.
? Why do I do things a certain way
? Why do I start developing every game project in the same exact way
? Who am I, creatively

There is a loud voice in my head that states that I am a fraud, that I am this little piece of a blank puzzle.

I still appreciate the fact that we have access to all this information and content regarding videogames, but what exactly do I really know about this art form that I truly love?

"
Been living in an idea,
An idea from another man's mind.
"

The MA is helping me clear my notion of what a game is and what it can be. I've been interested in a bigger range of art forms that previously were unknown to me. Heck, I even discovered David OReilly's "The External World", which probably proves the point that I haven't been paying attention to creative references and more to people talking about how to create this or that mechanic for a videogame.

Note to self.\ Stop drinking unidentified potions. Study the fundamentals and build your own way of doing things.
