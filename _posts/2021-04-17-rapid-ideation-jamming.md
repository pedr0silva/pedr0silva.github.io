Working as an Unity tutor can become repetitive, as I am explaining similar processes over and over and analyzing other people's work in a more technical point of view. Besides final projects, every exercise has a standard submission type, and, after a while, they start looking all the same in a more abstract sense. In addition with some freelance work in which I mostly program what is asked of me, I don't have the amount of time that I crave to nurture my own creativity and projects.

Game jams are the most frequent escape from these chains, if I can be dramatic enough to call it that. Having the possibility to create a full artefact in an action-packed  weekend Is simply amazing, as you come out feeling better about yourself, be it because you have created one game you are proud of, or just because you have learned something from the experience. As suggested by Annakaisa Kultima, the summed up definition of a game jam can be expressed by "accelerated, constrained and opportunistic game creation events with public exposure" (2015). In fact, I have to argue the competition, consequence of the public exposure is probably one of the most important parts of participating in such event. It is instant feedback of your work and ideas, given by peers, hence definitely more honest than what is said by friends and family, which may "soften" their opinion.

In most of the mostly known jams, participants have to follow one specific theme, which limits their possibilities. It is commonly said that "limitation breeds creativity" which likely derives from a quote accredited to Orson Welles which states that "The absence of limitations is the enemy of art.". These words of advice, supposedly given to filmmaker Henry Jaglom in the early 90's (Squire, 1992) are a great motif to game jams, as participants get a hold of the theme right at the start of such event and have to really stretch the theme in every possible way to achieve a compelling design. Furthermore, the team members are part of these limitations. Have a great programmer working with you? Design something that highlights his capabilities. Three great artists? Work with a more artistic and conceptual approach. Even though these game creation events are associated, in it's conception to the independent industry, big studios have adopted smaller jams to develop in-house social interaction and ideation.

Regarding the practical side of things, my approach to game design is very iterative. It is possible that it is because I have a hard time conceptualizing a full game in it's first form and leave the middle part of stories in the void. In his book, "Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design", Scott Rogers refers that this is a common occurrence among game developers, specially when they are less experienced designers (2014).  Setting up an story, it's world and one or two characters is crucial to me, even if these ideas are far from complete. As such, I often start projects with a vague flashes of imagination and let the project inspire further design along the way. Normally that includes a block-out of a primitive world, writing the first scripts and set up the main mechanic or interesting, interactive part of the idea. Jonathan Blow, a very successful independent game developer and designer as mentioned that his approach is focused on the deeper side of the design, focusing on truly understanding what he is making before making it good (2018). Therefor, creating a design that communicates emotion to the players requires time and constant iteration. This approach is exactly what we cannot afford to do in a game jam, or else, very little would be presented in the end.

In conclusion, game creation events are a spectacular way of practising design and other, more technical skills, which seems perfect for educational purposes but far from an ideal situation to start a person's dream game. It is safe to say that, on the other hand, game jams can introduce ideas and prototypes that otherwise wouldn't exist and that make up for solid basis to prove a concept. Like many other examples, SUPERHOT that started as a submission by a group of friends to the [7DFPS](http://7dayfps.com/) game jam, as stated in their website.
