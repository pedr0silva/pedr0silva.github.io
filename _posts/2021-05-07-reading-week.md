Buying "The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse", by Charlie Mackesy was a decision based on the cover's illustration, which seemed beautifully honest. Although it seemed quite similar to "The Little Prince" in the first few pages, but took a turn into more simplistic words and more impactful illustrations.

The book tells a journey of a Boy and three animal companions, in a universe where simplicity, kindness and love are the only rules that exist and were the landscapes they inhabit show care and appreciation. I don't want to spoil the experience of reading this work of art, so I'll just leave my brief interpretation on the characters roles, attributing a single adjective to each of them. The Boy is the curious one, specially about life. The Mole is a personification of wisdom. The Horse is the knowledgeable and has a different view on the world, probably because he is much larger and taller than his three small-sized friends. My favorite character is the Fox, who doesn't say much.

I guess some of my insecurities are perfectly aligned with the Fox itself, which made its presence quite special to me.

There is a special message embedded inside this special book and I truly believe we can find a personal meaning every time we revisit it. A true work of art.
